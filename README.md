# DialogueEditor
An editor for our Unity Dialogue Module

This is the code for an app that we have designed to help us with the workflow of creating dialogues to use in our Unity Dialogue Module.Instead of having to write the Xml file by hand and thus have lots of trouble remembering the exact wording of each tag, etc.., this app allows us to very quickly whip up a Dialogue.xml using simple customizable parameters.
Then it is just a matter of adding it to our Unity project and drag it to the DialogueManager appropiate field. The UDM will read from the file and populate the multiple variables that our system uses to generate a dialogue.
